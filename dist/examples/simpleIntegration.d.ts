/**
 * This example simplifies the integration of the aws4-express middleware into an express application.
 * It demonstrates how to use the awsVerify middleware to authorize incoming requests.
 * The example uses the express.json() middleware to parse the incoming request body.
 * NOTE: aws4 is pretty strict about incoming request headers, so you may need to adjust the headers in your requests.
 * NOTE: the code in this example is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in production.
